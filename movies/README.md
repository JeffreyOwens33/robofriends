Movie Trailer Website

As part of my Nanodegree learning experience in becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, I am putting together a movie trailer website with the help of Udacity.

My code is written primarily in Python2.7.14

To get the program to work after dowloading all the files, run the entertainment_center.py file in Python's IDLE shell.

Contributers may submit a pull request on Github from a forked repository.
